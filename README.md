# Predicting Social Drivers of Pharmaceutical Wastewater Concentrations

## Overview
This project develops machine learning models to predict pharmaceutical presence and concentration levels
in community wastewater influent using demographic and socioeconomic data.

## Data
- Source: U.S. Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), 2014–2022
- Additional sources: OTC drug lists, controlled substances, veterinary drug databases
- Scale: Hundreds of thousands of prescription records per year after cleaning

## Methods
- Data cleaning and feature engineering in R
- Machine learning models in Python (multi-output KNN, decision tree, random forest)
- Dimensionality reduction with PCA for high-dimensional years
- Exploratory data analysis and temporal trend analysis
